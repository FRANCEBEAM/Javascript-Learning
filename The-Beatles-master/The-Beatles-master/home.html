                A taste of honey
                Tasting much sweeter than wine
                I dream of your first kiss
                And then I feel upon my lips again
                A taste of honey

                I will return, yes I will return
                I'll come back for the honey and you
                Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
                There lingers still, though we're far apart
                That taste of honey
                Tasting much sweeter than wine
                Oh I will return, yes I will return
                I'll come back (He'll come back)
                for the honey (For the honey)
                and you
                There is a place
                Where I can go
                When I feel low
                When I feel blue
                And it's my mind
                And there's no time when I'm alone
                I think of you
                And things you do
                Go 'round my head
                The things you said
                Like "I love only you"
                In my mind there's no sorrow
                Don't you know that it's so
                There'll be no sad tomorrow
                Don't you know that it's so
                There is a place
                Where I can go
                When I feel low
                When I feel blue
                And it's my mind
                And there's no time when I'm alone
                There's a place...

Oh like dreamers do
Like dreamers do  

Hello little girl
Hello little girl
Hello little girl

When I see you everyday
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When you're passing on your way
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I see you passing by
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I try to catch your eye
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"

I send you flowers but you don't care
You never seem to see me standing there
I often wonder what you're thinking of
I hope it's me and love love love

So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say, "Mm you're my little girl"

It's not the first time that it's happened to me,
It's been a long lonely time
And it's funny funny to see that I'm about to lose my mind mind mind

So I hope there'll come a day
When you say, "Mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm"
You're my little girl, oh yeah
You're my little girl

Do do do do do Cha-cha-boom!
Besame besame mucho
Each time I bring you a kiss
I hear music divine
So besame besame mucho
I love you forever
Say that you'll always be mine

Cha-cha-boom!
Dearest one, if you should leave me

But won't you tell me how do you do it?

Gonna mail it to my local D.J.
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart beating rhythm
While my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I caught it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm reviews
Roll over Beethoven
We're rockin' in two by two

Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just triffle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
A rocking in two by two - Ooo

Well early in the morning
I'm a giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see them reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven

But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing

Till there was you
Till there was you That boy took my love away
Though he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry

This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again
